I created an etch-a-sketch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where each square changes color when you hover your mouse over it. I also implemented a shading feature where the squares become progressively darker each time they are hovered over. In addition, I added a feature to allow users to change the size of the grid, providing a more customizable user experience!
